            "Reference Answer: Offer frequent fluids, light clothing, and lukewarm sponging for comfort. For fever control, use acetaminophen 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours (max 5 doses/day) or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours if age ≥6 months, avoiding aspirin. Seek urgent care for temperature ≥104°F (40°C), lethargy, neck stiffness, breathing difficulty, dehydration signs, seizure, or a rash that does not blanch. If the child is drinking and otherwise well, home monitoring is reasonable, but arrange pediatric review if symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours or worsen.\n",

            "Reference Answer: Start with oral rehydration solution in small, frequent sips and introduce bland foods as tolerated while avoiding alcohol, very fatty foods, and large amounts of sugar. If there is no blood or high fever, loperamide 4 mg once then 2 mg after each loose stool (max 8 mg/day OTC) can reduce frequency; avoid it with bloody diarrhea or suspected invasive infection. Seek care for dehydration, severe or persistent pain, fever ≥101.5°F (38.6°C), symptoms lasting more than 48–72 hours, recent antibiotic use, or concerning travel exposures.

            "Reference Answer: Apply firm direct pressure with a clean cloth or gauze for ten minutes without checking, then rinse under running water once bleeding slows, remove visible debris, apply a thin layer of antiseptic or antibiotic ointment, and cover with a clean dressing. Go for care if the wound is deep or gaping, bleeding continues despite pressure, there is numbness or weakness, or contamination from bites or dirty metal. Update tetanus if it has been more than ten years, or more than five years for dirty wounds. Keep the area clean and dry and change the dressing daily while watching for infection.\n",

It is important to determine the cause of the chest pain in order to provide appropriate treatment. Angina is a type of chest pain that is caused by a decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle.

Avoid strenuous activity and seek immediate evaluation; if pain is severe or lasts more than five minutes, especially with sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath, call emergency services. If not allergic and no active bleeding, a single 325 mg chewable aspirin may be considered while awaiting care. Red flags include pain radiating to the arm, jaw, or back, dizziness or fainting, and new symptoms in adults over 40 or with cardiac risk factors.

            "Generated Answer: Fever is a normal physiologic response of the body to infection, inflammation, or trauma. Fever is not an illness, but rather a symptom of an illness. Fever can be caused by bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. It can also be caused by noninfectious illnesses, such as inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. The most common cause of fever in children is viral infection.\n",

For fever control, use acetaminophen 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours (max 5 doses/day) or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours if age ≥6 months, avoiding aspirin. Seek urgent care for temperature ≥104°F (40°C), lethargy, neck stiffness, breathing difficulty, dehydration signs, seizure, or a rash that does not blanch.
