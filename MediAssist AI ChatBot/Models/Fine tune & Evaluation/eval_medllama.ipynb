            "Generated Answer: .See a doctor immediately if you have a sudden, severe headache, especially if accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, neck stiffness, loss of vision, speech, or weakness on one side of the body. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin, may help ease the pain temporarily. However, if the headache persists or worsens, seek medical attention promptly. Headaches can be caused by various factors, including stress, lack of sleep, dehydration, hormonal changes, or underlying medical conditions. It is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. They can assess your symptoms, perform necessary tests, and.\n",
            "Reference Answer: Rest in a dark, quiet room, hydrate with water or an electrolyte drink, and consider acetaminophen 500–1,000 mg every 6–8 hours (max 3,000 mg/day) or ibuprofen 200–400 mg every 6–8 hours with food (max 1,200 mg/day OTC; avoid in pregnancy, ulcers, kidney disease, or if on blood thinners). Seek urgent care if this is a sudden “worst headache,” if there are new neurologic symptoms, fever with neck stiffness, head injury, or pregnancy with high blood pressure. Limit screens, track triggers like stress or caffeine, and arrange follow-up if headaches are frequent or disabling.\n",

For fever control, use acetaminophen 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours (max 5 doses/day) or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours if age ≥6 months, avoiding aspirin. Seek urgent care for temperature ≥104°F (40°C), lethargy, neck stiffness, breathing difficulty, dehydration signs, seizure, or a rash that does not blanch.

Clean the wound with soap and water, rinse with clean water, and pat dry. 2. Apply gentle pressure with a sterile gauze pad for 10 minutes. If the bleeding stops, no dressing is needed.

Go for care if the wound is deep or gaping, bleeding continues despite pressure, there is numbness or weakness, or contamination from bites or dirty metal. Update tetanus if it has been more than ten years, or more than five years for dirty wounds. Keep the area clean and dry and change the dressing daily while watching for infection.\n",
