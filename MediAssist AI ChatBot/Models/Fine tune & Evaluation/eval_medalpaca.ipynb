In the meantime, you can take Acetaminophen (Tylenol) every 6 hours as needed for mild to moderate pain. However, do not take more than 3 grams (3,000 milligrams) of Tylenol in a 24-hour period. Consult with your healthcare provider if you have any questions about your medication regimen.\n",
            "Reference Answer: Rest in a dark, quiet room, hydrate with water or an electrolyte drink, and consider acetaminophen 500–1,000 mg every 6–8 hours (max 3,000 mg/day) or ibuprofen 200–400 mg every 6–8 hours with food (max 1,200 mg/day OTC; avoid in pregnancy, ulcers, kidney disease, or if on blood thinners). Seek urgent care if this is a sudden “worst headache,” if there are new neurologic symptoms, fever with neck stiffness, head injury, or pregnancy with high blood pressure. Limit screens, track triggers like stress or caffeine, and arrange follow-up if headaches are frequent or disabling.\n",

If you are experiencing persistent chest discomfort, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional. They can help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment options. Here are some steps you can take to help alleviate your chest symptoms: 1. Avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities, and prolonged standing or sitting. 2.\n",
            "Reference Answer: Treat exertional chest pain as potentially serious. Avoid strenuous activity and seek immediate evaluation; if pain is severe or lasts more than five minutes, especially with sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath, call emergency services. If not allergic and no active bleeding, a single 325 mg chewable aspirin may be considered while awaiting care. Red flags include pain radiating to the arm, jaw, or back, dizziness or fainting, and new symptoms in adults over 40 or with cardiac risk factors. An ECG and troponin testing help determine next steps.\n",

For fever control, use acetaminophen 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours (max 5 doses/day) or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours if age ≥6 months, avoiding aspirin. Seek urgent care for temperature ≥104°F (40°C), lethargy, neck stiffness, breathing difficulty, dehydration signs, seizure, or a rash that does not blanch.

Go for care if the wound is deep or gaping, bleeding continues despite pressure, there is numbness or weakness, or contamination from bites or dirty metal.

            "Reference Answer: Rest in a dark, quiet room, hydrate with water or an electrolyte drink, and consider acetaminophen 500–1,000 mg every 6–8 hours (max 3,000 mg/day) or ibuprofen 200–400 mg every 6–8 hours with food (max 1,200 mg/day OTC; avoid in pregnancy, ulcers, kidney disease, or if on blood thinners). Seek urgent care if this is a sudden “worst headache,” if there are new neurologic symptoms, fever with neck stiffness, head injury, or pregnancy with high blood pressure. Limit screens, track triggers like stress or caffeine, and arrange follow-up if headaches are frequent or disabling.\n",

            "Reference Answer: Treat exertional chest pain as potentially serious. Avoid strenuous activity and seek immediate evaluation; if pain is severe or lasts more than five minutes, especially with sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath, call emergency services. If not allergic and no active bleeding, a single 325 mg chewable aspirin may be considered while awaiting care. Red flags include pain radiating to the arm, jaw, or back, dizziness or fainting, and new symptoms in adults over 40 or with cardiac risk factors.

            "Reference Answer: Offer frequent fluids, light clothing, and lukewarm sponging for comfort. For fever control, use acetaminophen 10–15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours (max 5 doses/day) or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg every 6–8 hours if age ≥6 months, avoiding aspirin. Seek urgent care for temperature ≥104°F (40°C), lethargy, neck stiffness, breathing difficulty, dehydration signs, seizure, or a rash that does not blanch. If the child is drinking and otherwise well, home monitoring is reasonable, but arrange pediatric review if symptoms persist beyond 48–72 hours or worsen.\n",

            "Reference Answer: Start with oral rehydration solution in small, frequent sips and introduce bland foods as tolerated while avoiding alcohol, very fatty foods, and large amounts of sugar. If there is no blood or high fever, loperamide 4 mg once then 2 mg after each loose stool (max 8 mg/day OTC) can reduce frequency; avoid it with bloody diarrhea or suspected invasive infection.

Go for care if the wound is deep or gaping, bleeding continues despite pressure, there is numbness or weakness, or contamination from bites or dirty metal.
